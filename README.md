ðŸ“Š Linear Regression with MSE & MAE Evaluation
This project explores Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning, and evaluates its performance using two key metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The notebook provides a practical guide to building, evaluating, and interpreting a linear regression model.

ðŸ“– Key Highlights
Data Preparation:

Preprocess data to ensure quality inputs for regression analysis.
Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Model Implementation:

Apply linear regression to predict target variables based on input features.
Visualize relationships between predictors and the target variable.
Performance Metrics:

Evaluate model accuracy using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Quantifies average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average absolute difference for a more interpretable evaluation.
Visualization:

Plot actual vs. predicted values to assess model fit.
Visualize residuals to understand error distribution.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Build a linear regression model for predictive analysis.
Evaluate model performance using MSE and MAE metrics.
Gain insights into the relationship between predictors and the target variable.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Python Libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical computations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
Scikit-learn for linear regression implementation and evaluation metrics.
Jupyter Notebook:

Interactive environment for code development and visualization.

ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights

Built a reliable linear regression model for predicting target values.
